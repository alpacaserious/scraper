# Coppermine Gallery Downloader

WIP - Aiming for feature parity with existing downloaders.

Inspired mainly by [long-live](https://github.com/kivaar/long-live) but I wanted something simpler and rustier.

## Usage
Supports downloading albums and categories from online galleries that are powered by Coppermine.

Run with:

`$ scraper <url>`,

`$ scraper <file>` with a file that contains a list of URL's.
