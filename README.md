# Coppermine Gallery Downloader

WIP - Aiming for feature parity with existing downloaders.

Inspired mainly by [long-live](https://github.com/kivaar/long-live) but I wanted something simpler and rustier.

## Usage
Supports downloading albums and categories that only contain albums, i.e. no recursive scraping is implemented yet.

Run with: `$ scraper <url>` alternatively `$ scraper <file>` with a file that contains a list of URL's.
